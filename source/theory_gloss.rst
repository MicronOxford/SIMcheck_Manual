SIM Theory and Glossary of Terms
================================

Structured Illumination Microscopy achieves optical sectioning at double the
conventional resolution. This is achieved by collecting data using a series of
illumination patterns (typically stripes) of different phases and angles [#]_.
The illumination pattern interacts with real structures in the image
leading to observable patterns that report on structural information beyond the
resolution limit. By systematically sampling all the frequencies necessary to
produce a super-resolution image in this way, and shifting the high-frequency
information back to the correct position in frequency space, these separate
components can be combined to reconstruct a single super-resolution image. 3D
SIM [#]_ uses 5 phases and 3 or 5 angles to achieve a resolution doubling both
laterally (XY) and axially (Z).
