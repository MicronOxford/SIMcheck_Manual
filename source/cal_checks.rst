System Calibration
==================

Illumination Phase Steps (IPS)
------------------------

This plugin checks system stability and alignment by detecting illumination
pattern frequencies and plotting phase steps: the SI illumination pattern
must be in-focus, modulated with the proper frequencies, and accurate, stable
phase steps.

Illumination Pattern Focus (IPF)
--------------------------

TODO

Spherical Aberration Mismatch (SAM)
-----------------------------

This check plots the minimum, and the mean value in each slice; and summarizes
the standard deviation of the minimum value normalized by the stack mode
intensity. Large variations in the minimum value relative to the average
indicate refractive index mismatch or poor illumination pattern Z focus.
