SIMcheck Manual
===============

SIMcheck is a package of ImageJ tools for assessing the quality and reliability 
of Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) data. Although originally developed
for API OMX data, SIMcheck may be used with data from other systems including 
Zeiss's ELYRA and Nikon's N-SIM. It should work with any fairly recent ImageJ 
version, and can be installed by copying the ``SIMcheck_.jar`` file into your 
plugins folder and restarting ImageJ. 

Please read the Quick Start guide below.
